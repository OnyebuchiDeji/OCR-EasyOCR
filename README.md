##  Simple OCR in Python using EasyOCR

It helps to perform character recognition in a very simple way. It's very lightweight
and hence best used when simply checking that an image contains text. Moreover, it's
capable of extracting text from images. But it's not robust in accurately detecting characters.
However, I do require more exploring of the library.


###  Installation of EasyOCR

+   `pip install easyocr`
